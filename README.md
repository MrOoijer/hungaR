# hungaR

(a) A pure R implementation of the Hungarian method for the
minimum cost optimal mathcing problem. The runtime is 10-25 seconds on a 1000 by 1000 problem (assign 1000 jobs to 1000nactors). 

(b) The method of (a) is used to match N students to M advisers to supervise their (bachelors) thesis. This is an iterative process where, after reading in the basic data about students and advisers, the user can assign weights to prefered and non prefered combinations. The software will work out the best matching based on the weights.
