This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

This is meant as a working example for student-adviser matching. As this is not a library, you have to copy the source of the function we use. 

```{r}
source("hungar.R")
source("do_match.R")
```


## Read in data

At this moment it looks most elegant to do the data entry in a speadsheet and export/import  the data via csv files. Those three files have a simple structure: nr, name for students, nr, name and max for advisers and a wights table. Other columns are possible but not used in this algorithm.

The weights table has as header the names (or nr's) of the advisors, and a row for each student with in the first column a student id (name or nr). Cells can be empty, have a positive weight for student preference and can be marked with a single letter. At this moment we have "F" for a forbidden combination and "G" for a combination where student and adviser do not share a common subject.  

Here we process example files from the testdata folder.

```{r}

weights<- read.csv("./testdata/testoverzicht.csv", header=TRUE,
                   row.names=1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
students<- read.csv("./testdata/students.csv", 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
advisers<- read.csv("./testdata/advisers.csv", 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


## Post processing of the weights table

The next step is to replace some of the codes in the weights table by numbers and make the whole table numerical. 


```{r}
SUBJECT_MISMATCH = -50
TOO_MANY_STUDENTS = -100 ## overflow per advisor
FORBIDDEN_COMBINATION = -1000


cost <- weights
cost[ cost==""] <- 0
cost[cost=="G"] <- SUBJECT_MISMATCH
cost[cost=="F"] <- FORBIDDEN_COMBINATION
for (i in 1:ncol(cost))cost[,i] <-
      as.numeric(cost[,i])

if(sum(is.na(cost)) > 0){
  cat("\n\n*** Incomplete conversion")
  stop
}

```



Now we can do the matching 


```{r}
match_table<- do_match(cost, advisers$max, 
                  penalty = TOO_MANY_STUDENTS)

final_result<- data.frame(
  nr= students$nr[match_table$nr], 
  name= students$name[match_table$nr], 
  adviser= advisers$name[match_table$adviser],
  weight = match_table$value
)

```

## You might want to print or save the result

```{r}

# print or save final result
# write.csv(final_result, "fr.csv", row.names= FALSE, quote= FALSE)


knitr::kable(final_result, col.names= names(final_result), row.names=FALSE, caption="Best Matching")
```

## Diagnostics

Next look at some other details of the matching.

```{r}

diag1 <- aggregate(final_result[,3], 
                   by=list(final_result$adviser), 
                   FUN=length)
names(diag1)<- c("name", "nr_students")
diag1<- merge(advisers, diag1, by="name")

knitr::kable(diag1, caption="Adviser load")

diag2<- final_result[final_result$weight %in%
              c (0, SUBJECT_MISMATCH, 
                 FORBIDDEN_COMBINATION),]
diag2$message <- c("not a prefered adviser",
                   "subject mismatch",
                   "forbidden combination")[
                     match(diag2$weight,
                             c (0, SUBJECT_MISMATCH, 
                                FORBIDDEN_COMBINATION))
                     ]         
knitr::kable(diag2, caption= "Unfortunate matches")                 
```
